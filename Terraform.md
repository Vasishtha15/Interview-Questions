## Terraform FAQ

1. **Which components have you created using Terraform?**
   I have created the following components using Terraform:
   - Resource group
   - Security account
   - Network security group
   - Virtual machines (VMs) using Azure providers and VMware providers.

2. **How do you make changes to already created resources in Terraform?**
   To make changes to already created resources in Terraform, you can use the `terraform import` command. This command imports existing resources into Terraform.
   ```
   terraform import [options] ADDRESS ID
   ```

3. **Where is the state file stored when you run Terraform?**
   The state file maintains a mapping between the current infrastructure state and the configuration file. The state file can be stored on:
   - The local machine
   - Remote storage locations like Azure Storage Account or AWS S3 bucket
   - Terraform Cloud
   By default, it is stored locally as `terraform.tfstate`. Since the state file can contain sensitive information, it's recommended to store it on encrypted media.

4. **What do you do if you lose the state file?**
   Losing the Terraform state file can be problematic. To recover, you can consider these options:
   - **Backups:** If you have backups of your state file, you can restore it from there.
   - **Recreate Infrastructure:** If you have the configuration files, you can recreate the infrastructure.
   - **Reimport Resources:** If resources still exist in your cloud environment, you can import them back into Terraform's state using `terraform import`.
   - **Collaboration and Documentation:** Check if team members have the state file or gather information from cloud provider consoles or APIs.
   - **Rebuilding and Testing:** As a last resort, recreate the infrastructure configuration from scratch.

5. **List some features of Terraform:**
   - Supports multiple cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, VMware
   - Uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) for human-readable infrastructure code
   - Provides a HashiCorp Configuration Language for easy code creation

6. **What does the `terraform validate` command do?**
   The `terraform validate` command checks the syntax of Terraform files in a directory and displays warnings and errors for invalid syntax.

7. **What are some common errors caught by `terraform validate`?**
   Errors caught include syntax errors, unknown resources/providers, missing attributes, invalid argument names/IDs, and unused variables.

8. **What is Infrastructure as Code (IAC)?**
   IAC enables building, changing, and managing infrastructure through code rather than manual processes.

9. **What is the lifecycle block in Terraform?**
   The lifecycle block controls how certain resources are managed throughout their lifecycle.

10. **Terraform vs. Ansible:**
    Choose based on needs:
    - Terraform: For building infrastructure from scratch, maintaining steady state
    - Ansible: For managing evolving/changing infrastructure, procedural approach

11. **How to use `terraform destroy` targeting specific resources?**
    You can use `terraform destroy -target=resource_type.resource_name`.

12. **How can you store keys?**
    Keys can be stored in environment variables, Terraform variables, or secret management tools.

13. **Explain Modules:**
    - **Root Module:** The main directory with .tf files. Can include child or published modules.
    - **Child Module:** Called by another module (usually the Root module).
    - **Published Modules:** Pushed to private/public repository.

14. **What is a remote backend in Terraform?**
    A remote backend stores the Terraform state file externally, promoting collaboration, data persistence, and security.

15. **Examples of remote backends:**
    HashiCorp Terraform Cloud, AWS S3, Azure Storage, Google Cloud Storage.

16. **How do you provide variables at runtime?**
    Variables are stored in `var.tf`. Pass them with `-var` flag or use `-var-file` flag to provide values from a `.tfvar` file.

17. **Can you manage Terraform code across multiple environments?**
    Yes, by using Terraform workspaces or reusable modules.

18. **CloudFormation vs. Terraform:**
    - CloudFormation: YAML/JSON
    - Terraform: HCL
